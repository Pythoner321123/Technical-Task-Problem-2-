# Technical-Task-Problem-2-

Implement a program that synchronizes two folders: source and replica. The program should maintain a full, identical copy of destination folder at replica folder.
Requirements:
Synchronization must be one-way: after the synchronization content of the replica folder should be modified to exactly match content of the source folder;
Synchronization should be performed periodically;
File creation/copying/removal operations should be logged to a file and to the console output;
Folder paths, synchronization interval and log file path should be provided using the command line arguments.

At the top we have our two variables in which you will have to provide two directories. One will be for the source file and the other will be for our destination. 
I've provided the code with comments so that it is more readable. It's pretty self explanatory.
